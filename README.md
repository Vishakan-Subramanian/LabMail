# LabMail

LabMail is a Java application built for my 12th standard school project.
It works alongside a MYSQL database server for storing and retrieving information.

The application is meant to be run from different systems connected by a single LAN connection,
with the server computer(for MYSQL) operational.

When done so, users can create their own accounts, similar to a GMail account.
Once an account is setup, they can login to their accounts and send/receive messages(mail)
to other existing users through the application.

Features of the application include:

1   Account Creation for a user

2   A Password Recovery System, incase user forgets his/her password

3   Ability to send and receive text messages

4   Ability to delete messages and refresh the application to check for new mail.

5   Auto synchronization of the user's account with the database every 5 seconds.

6   Can work on systems connected to the same LAN connection

7   Uses a DBMS(MYSQL) server for efficient and secure storage of user data

8   60000 character limit per message

9   Exact Date and Time of Message Arrival is shown

10  Outbox and Inbox can be accessed by the user

11  If any messages are unchecked, it is indicated by a Filled Mailbox image
    Otherwise, the image is an Empty Mailbox
    
12  A Feedback Form for the user to submit.
